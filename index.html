        <h1>Mason Williams</h1>
        <p>Hi my name is Mason Williams and I'm from San Jose, California. I'm the oldest of 4 boys. 
            This is my first semester at BYUI, and I'm currently living on campus at Centre Square. 
            I really like playing, making, and listening to music and I'm lucky enough to be taking a few music classes here at BYUI this semester that I'm super stoked about. 
            Also, being from California I really like to go to the ocean with my family and friends.  
            I took a couple computer science related classes in high school, where I learned how to code in javascript and python.</p>
